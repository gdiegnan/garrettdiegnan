				<p>This section of the website will feature my favorite photographs that I've taken of all time. This page will feature pictures over a variety of genres, locations, and time periods, and I will continue to update it as I continue taking photographs. Each photograph will be featured in a larger size that you may see it on the 'Collections' page, and you will also get the opportunity to get to read a little bit of the story behind the picture.</p>

					<!-- <p class="explain">From my airports series, there's always something magical about airports that you can't really get anywhere else. International travel has also shown me how different American chains are in other countries. This 7-Eleven in an airport in Denmark is unlike any I've ever seen in America. Something about the long line up of candy along the one wall, with the slightly retro looking colors of the sign drew my eye, and something in me felt the need to snap a photo. Also after taking this photo I was able to get a chicken and pesto sandwhich from this very 7-Eleven, which was surprisingly one of the best sandwiches I've ever had (so I guess Danish 7-Eleven > American 7-Eleven)</p> -->
