				<h2 class="aboutHeaders">About Me!</h2>
				<p class="aboutP">Hi, I'm Garrett Diegnan, and I am currently a senior at Columbia High School. I currently have a 4.492 weighted GPA and a 3.815 unweighted GPA. I have taken 3 AP classes previosuly: AP Computer Science Principles (5 on test), AP United States History (5 on test), and AP Calculus BC (4 on test). I am currently enrolled in AP Statistics, AP U.S. Government and Politics, AP Physics C, and Advanced Calculus III and Linear Algebra. I have also completed a Pre-College course in Intermediate Computer Science at Stevens Institute of Technology, as well as a summer-long circuit in Web Design, HTML, and CSS with General Assembly. I am a member of my school's chapter of the National Honor Society</p>
				<br>
				<p class="aboutP">I am a Scout with Troop 5, Maplewood, and earned the rank of Eagle Scout in July, 2020. I have earned my troop's Advancement Award (2015), the Camping Award (2017), the Elmer Menke Memorial Leadership Award (2019), and the Scout of the Year Award (2020). In my troop's 100 year history, only seven other scouts have won more awards. I am also a Brotherhood level of the Order of the Arrow, and have held several positions within the troop including: Den Chief, Quartermaster, Scribe, Patrol Leader, and Assistant Senior Patrol Leader.</p>
				<br>
				<p class="aboutP">I am a four year member of my school's Future Business Leaders of America (FBLA) chapter, and serving as the club's current Vice President. I have played club soccer for a travel team for 6 years. I have taken piano lessons for the past 11 years. I am a founding member of my school's Photography Club, and a co-software leader for our online magazine <i>Capture CHS</i>. I have also gotten to do a lot of community service throughout my time in scouting, and with other activites, and have completed more than 180 hours of community service in my local community.

				<h2 class="aboutHeaders">My Photography Journey</h2>
				<p class="aboutP">My interest in photography began at a young age. My family got a digital camera when I was very young, and we would bring it on every trip we went on. At my elementary school, there were offerings to do "enrichments" which were essentially clubs, and in third grade, I took a photography enrichment, which gave me my first chance to start trying out the family camera.</p>
				<br>
				<p class="aboutP">In middle school, my family got a newer digital camera, and I began taking it on family trips and taking pictures. While I never took any photography classes or lessons, my photography skills gradually started to improve, and I started to take pictures more often. In 8th grade, I bought a book called <i>Read this If You Want to Take Great Photographs</i> which was the first time I began to think of photography in a different way, and I started to understand things I could change to improve my photography skills.<p> 
				<br>
				<p class="aboutP">That book also started talking about shutter speeds and aperture sizes and ISO, and all these different features I realized my family camera didn't have. I was able to convince my parents to get me a newer digital camera, and as a combined Christmas and birthday present in 10th grade, I received a brand new Canon camera, with all the features I had been looking for. I began experimenting with these new settings, and trying out my new camera on different trips.</p>
				<br>
				<p class="aboutP">During my sophomore year, I took two photography classes in school, which began to take my understanding and love for photography to another level. For the first two quarters, I took a traditional photography class, where I got to try out film photography and take part in the entire film and photo development process. I also began getting a better understanding of all these new settings on my camera, and began to learn different photography techniques and strategies for improving my photographs. During the second half of the year I took a digital photography class, which as my photography teacher explains, "goes into the <i>why</i> of photography". I began trying more experimental projects (which you can see under the projects section), as well as improving my ability to operate my digital camera, as well as getting to try out Photoshop and other photo editing tools.</p>
				<br>
				<p class="aboutP">Over the many years that I have become interested in photography, my abilities have improved and evolved. And with that, my style and photography subjects have changed with it as well. Although I'm not very photogenic myself (as you can tell from my picture above), I have become interested in portraits, street photography, nature photography, and many other styles. Combining my love of photography, as well as the skills I have learned from various Computer Science classes, including the Web Design, HTML, and CSS circuit I took with General Assembly this summer, I decided to code my own website from scratch to share all my photographs. On this site, you can see how my photography has evolved over time. If you want to read up on how to navigate this site, read below, or just feel free to browse around different sections of the website!</p> 
				<h2 class="aboutHeaders">How to Navigate This Site</h2>
				<p class="aboutP">The home page is your standard landing page. It features a picture of a mustang that I photographed in a field in the Catskills, NY, and you can also check out a few of my other featured photos as well. Under the Gallery page, you can check out all of my photos that I have published all in one place. Under the Projects page, it will sort my work into different categories. These categories will either be different locations I have been able to photograph, or different projects I did for my photography classes in school, or even different categories of photography, such as portraits. Lastly the About page that you just read features different information about me personally. If you scroll to the very bottom of the site, you can also see a brief footer note about the website, and will also be able to navigate the site from down there as well! (P.S. this site is best viewed on desktop!)</p>
