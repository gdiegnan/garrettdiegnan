				<h2>Projects</h2>
				<p>This section features every different project I've worked on to date. Some of the projects featured on here are from specific assignments/projects I had in my digital photography class, which are a little bit more experimental than my traditional work, and some of them are other side projects or collections I have amassed over my lifetime.</p>

					<h3>Lyrics</h3>
					<p>One of the earlier projects we had for digital photography was to pick a specific song and take photos that relate to the lyrics or meaning of the song in some form. The song I chose was '39 by Queen (<i>A Night at the Opera</i>, 1975), written by guitarist, Brian May. Brian May, in addition to being a world-class guitarist in one of the most famous bands of all time, he also has PhD in Astrophyiscs, and happens to be somewhat of a sci-fi nerd. In this song, May explores Einstein's Theory of Relativity, and specifically time dilation. In the song, a few astronauts leave Earth, in search of a new planet to be able to resettle upon, only to come back and realize 100 years have passed due to time dilation, and humanity has since ended. I chose a happier part of the song to represent, in which the astronauts are exploring their newly found, potential home, and my photographs represent how small these explores are in this massive world they are exploring.</p>

					<h3>Deconstruction</h3>
					<p>Another project we worked on was called deconstruction. In this projet we broke down things we look at everyday (my garage, tree in my backyard, signs at the end of my street, etc.) and photographed them in different sections. We then put these different sections back together to form a more complete, yet fragmented image. There was also a side portion of this project where we were able to photograph members of my school's Special Dance team and get to explore the beauty of dance from a different perspective. This project allowed me to view things from different angles and understandings, and show how many perspectives merged into one creates a drastically different image than the original.</p>

					<h3>Airports</h3>
					<p>Airports always held such a magical energy in my mind. The aura of an airport isn't really comparable to anything else in life. So many people, going so many different places, all under one building for just a few hours, only to likely never see any of them ever again. As long as I am not running late for my flight, airports always gave me such calming energy, being able to look at all the different people from so many different places, so many cultures all waiting together. This collection below are some different pictures I've taken in airports, either of different people I'll never see again, or different terminals connecting different flights together, or anything else.</p>

					<h3>People</h3>
					<p>Photographing people is always something I have struggled with, possibly more than anything else I've ever photographed. I always love looking at great portrait photography, but it's not something I have been able to master. However, I have always loved at least <i>trying</i> to photograph people. Most of my people photography occurs much more in a candid format rather than a portrait format, which to me feels more geniune. While I have done some portrait shots in a studio before, all the pictures below are environmental portraits, with people in their natural habitat.</p>

					<h3>Light</h3>
					<p>There is no greater anticipation in life than when you're waiting for a firework. Whether it's lighting small fireworks with your friends by hand, or watching fireworks being launched up on the 4th of July or on any other special occasion, it is always a phenomenal event. This section attempts to showcase light in one of its truest forms, or even in the anticipation of a firework. Night photography and low-light photography is always very tricky, and is something I am ever working to improve on.</p>
